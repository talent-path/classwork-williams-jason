Rules of Chess:

two player game, played on an 8x8 grid
each side gets 8 pawn (along their 2nd row)
each side gets a back row with following pieces (in order):

Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, Bishop, Knight, Rook

Goal:
    "capture" the enemy king (Movement rules mean we don't actually capture, but get to where they have no choice)


Movement Rules:
    Pawns can move forward 1 normally
        On their first move, pawns can move forward 2
        if they move forward two, and they go through a square where an enemy pawn could capture,
            the pawn can STILL capture as though the piece had only moved one ("en passant" or "in passing")
    Pawns can only caputure diagonally (one forward and one to the right or left)
    When Pawns reach the last row, they can promote to any other piece (beside a King)

    Knights can "jump" (pieces in between don't matter)
        Knights move 2 in a direction and then left or right one (an "L" shape)

    Bishops "slide" (can't move through pieces, but can capture enemy pieces) diagonally

    Rooks "slide" either horizontally or vertically

    Queens "slide" horizontally, vertically, or diagonally

    Kings move one square in any direction (horizontally, vertically, diagonally)

    You can't move in such a way that your king would be captured on the next move (can't place your king "in check")


    If the king moves, he loses the ability to "castle"
    If either rook moves, we can no longer castle on that side
    Castling means moving the king two squares either left or right and placing the rook on the other side of the king
        all squares between the king and rook must be clear
        the king cannot be in check when castling starts
        the king cannot move through a square where they would be in check
    
    if no pawn has moved and there have been no checks in 50 moves, the game ends in draw

    if the same "state" of the board is hit 3 times, the game ends in a draw ("three fold repitition")
